# Important Information!
## FVTT Version compatibility
My focus is the FVTTs stable branch. I will neither promise nor prioritise updates for FVTTs beta or alpha branches! Feel free to report a bug so i know whats coming, but don't expect a fix before a stable FVTT update.

## Bug Reporting and Feature Suggestions
Go to the [GitHub's issue board](https://github.com/Moerill/fvtt-pointer/issues) and create an issue with the template fitting to what you want to post and follow its instructions.

**I will ignore/delete half-hearted bug reports ignoring the issue template or Discord mentions!**  
Its not difficult to put at least some effort into something that you want someone else to put their spare time into to fix!

All were slightly modified to fully fill their square and width/height attributes were added so they're compatible with FVTT as SVG.

## Support the development
I'm doing this project mostly alone (with partial help of some wonderful people) in my spare time and for free.  
If you want to encourage me to keep doing this, i am happy about all kind of tokens of appreciation. (Like some nice words, recommending this project or contributions to the project).  
What about donations? I do feel very honored that you think about giving me a donation! But instead I'd prefer if you send the cash to a good cause of your choosing!
